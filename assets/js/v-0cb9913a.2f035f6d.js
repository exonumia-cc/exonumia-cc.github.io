It&#39;s completely decentralized with no server or central authority.</p><p>See bitcoin.org for screenshots.</p><p>Download link: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/bitcoin/bitcoin-0.1.0.rar</p><p>Windows only for now. Open source C++ code is included.</p><ul><li>Unpack the files into a directory</li><li>Run BITCOIN.EXE</li><li>It automatically connects to other nodes</li></ul><p>If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections, you&#39;ll really be helping the network a lot. Port 8333 on your firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.</p><p>The software is still alpha and experimental. There&#39;s no guarantee the system&#39;s state won&#39;t have to be restarted at some point if it becomes necessary, although I&#39;ve done everything I can to build in extensibility and versioning.</p><p>You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on Options-&gt;Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. I made the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to generate coins in just a few hours. It&#39;ll get a lot harder when competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty. Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be spent.</p><p>There are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public key and send the transaction with comments. If the recipient is not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which is a hash of their public key that they give you. They&#39;ll receive the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it&#39;s in. This method has the disadvantage that no comment information is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can&#39;t be online at the same time or the recipient can&#39;t receive incoming connections.</p><p>Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It&#39;ll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years.</p><p>first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins<br> next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins<br> next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins<br> next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins<br> etc...</p><p>When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if needed. It&#39;s based on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.</p><p>Satoshi Nakamoto</p><hr><p>The Cryptography Mailing List Unsubscribe by sending &quot;unsubscribe cryptography&quot; to majord...@metzdowd.com</p>",15),l={},h=(0,n(83744).Z)(l,[["render",function(e,t){const n=(0,o.up)("OutboundLink"),l=(0,o.up)("LanguageDropdown");return(0,o.wg)(),(0,o.iD)(o.HY,null,[i,(0,o._)("p",null,[a,(0,o._)("a",s,[r,(0,o.Wm)(n)])]),(0,o.Wm)(l),c],64)}]])},83744:(e,t)=>{t.Z=(e,t)=>{const n=e.__vccOpts||e;for(const[e,o]of t)n[e]=o;return n}}}]);
