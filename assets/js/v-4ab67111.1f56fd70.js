Each chapter looks at Bitcoin through a different lens, extracting what lessons can be learned by inspecting this strange network from a different angle.</p><p><a href="#chapter-i-philosophy">Chapter 1</a> explores the philosophical teachings of Bitcoin. The interplay of immutability and change, the concept of true scarcity, Bitcoin&#39;s immaculate conception, the problem of identity, the contradiction of replication and locality, the power of free speech, and the limits of knowledge.</p><p><a href="#chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> explores the economic teachings of Bitcoin. Lessons about financial ignorance, inflation, value, money and the history of money, fractional reserve banking, and how Bitcoin is re-introducing sound money in a sly, roundabout way.</p><p><a href="#chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> explores some of the lessons learned by examining the technology of Bitcoin. Why there is strength in numbers, reflections on trust, why telling time takes work, how moving slowly and not breaking things is a feature and not a bug, what Bitcoin&#39;s creation can tell us about privacy, why cypherpunks write code (and not laws), and what metaphors might be useful to explore Bitcoin&#39;s future.</p><p>Each lesson contains several quotes and links throughout the text.

If you like to go deeper, links to the most relevant material are listed in the &quot;Down the Rabbit Hole&quot; section. Both can be found at the end of each lesson.</p><p>Even though some prior knowledge about Bitcoin is beneficial, I hope that these lessons can be digested by any curious reader. While some relate to each other, each lesson should be able to stand on its own and can be read independently. I did my best to shy away from technical jargon, even though some domain-specific vocabulary is unavoidable.</p><p>I hope that my writing serves as inspiration for others to dig beneath the surface and examine some of the deeper questions Bitcoin raises. My own inspiration came from a multitude of authors and content creators to all of whom I am eternally grateful.</p><p>Last but not least: my goal in writing this is not to convince you of anything.

Thanks to the power of exponentials, the number of bitcoin mined per year will drop below 100 bitcoin in 50 years and below 1 bitcoin in 75 years. The global faucet which is the block reward will dry up somewhere around the year 2140, effectively stopping the production of bitcoin. This is a long game.
